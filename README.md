# Books Annotations
Code for extracting annotations and highlights from the iBooks/Books app on iPhone and iPad

1. Download iExplorer - https://macroplant.com/iexplorer/download/mac/complete/4.6.0.
2. Plug in your iPhone/iPad.
3. Copy [iPhone Name] > Media > Books > iBooksData2.plist to your Desktop.
4. Run 

The iBooksData2.plist seems to only have old annotations, for me up to Nov 2018.
The recent data is in [iPhone Name] > Media > Books > com.apple.ibooks-sync.plist.

Also download [iPhone Name] > Media > Books > Sync > Books.plist.
